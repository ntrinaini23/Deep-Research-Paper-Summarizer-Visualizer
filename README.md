# Deep-Research-Paper-Summarizer-Visualizer
This project provides an end-to-end pipeline for summarizing research papers and visualizing their knowledge structure. It leverages NLP techniques for summarization, builds a glossary of key terms, enhances visuals, and generates a professional PDF report with graphs and structured formatting.
Key Features:

📄 Extracts and summarizes research papers into concise, human-readable insights.

📚 Builds a glossary of key technical terms for better understanding.

📊 Generates a knowledge graph to visualize relationships.

🖼️ Enhances images/figures for inclusion in the final report.

📝 Exports a PDF report with summary, glossary, graphs, and figures.

⚡ Supports Unicode fonts (DejaVu) for multilingual compatibility.

Tech Stack:

Python 3.10+

TensorFlow / Transformers

FPDF for PDF generation

NetworkX / Matplotlib for graph visualization

Usage:

python main.py


Future Scope:

Integration with Large Language Models (LLMs) for better summarization.

Support for multiple input formats (PDF, arXiv links, etc.).

Web UI for non-technical users.
